üëã **Hello! Here's an overview of the bot.**

This bot's purpose is to track who writes the dumbest messages in chat most often.  
Currently, it supports several commands:

üí¨ **Checking the Leaderboard:**  
`!s checkldb(optional number)`  
Returns the full leaderboard, listing all members with at least one dumb message.  

üìå **Limit the results by adding a number.**  
Example: `!s checkldb5` ‚Äî Returns the top 5 people with the most dumb messages.  

üìñ **Getting Top Messages from a User:**  
`!s top_msg(optional number) (username)`  
Shows the top ten messages from the specified user that received the most votes against them.  

üìå **Limit the results by adding a number.**  
Example: `!s top_msg5 username_to_check` ‚Äî Returns the top 5 messages for the user 'username_to_check'.  
üìå **Note:** The username is the global username, not the server nickname or display name.  

üî¢ **Get a Specific Top Message by Rank:**  
`!s get_top_number(number) (username)`  
Fetches a specific message based on the user's `RC_APPROVAL` ranking.  

üìå **Limit the results by providing a number (rank).**  
Example: `!s get_top_number10 username_to_check` ‚Äî Returns the 10th most approved message for the user 'username_to_check'.  
'''

part2= '''
‚öôÔ∏è **Adjust Server Settings:**  
`!s adjust (setting) (value)`  
Allows administrators to adjust various server settings. The available settings are:

- `timer_length`: Set the timer for a specific task (must be an integer).  
- `vote_threshold`: Set the threshold for votes (must be an integer).  
- `gifs`: Toggle the use of GIFs (either "on" or "off").  
- `safe_message`: Set a custom message that will be displayed if a message is voted not dumb.  
- `dumb_message`: Set a custom message that will be displayed if a message is voted dumb.  
- `prefix_message`: Set a custom command prefix message.

üìå **Format of message:**  
`prefix_message` `safe_message/dumb_message` 

üìå **Example of adjusting settings:**  
`!s adjust timer_length 10` ‚Äî Sets the timer length to 10.  
`!s adjust gifs on` ‚Äî Enables GIFs.  

üßë‚Äçüíº **Analyze a User's Messages:**  
`!s analyze (username)`  
Analyzes a user's messages based on incidents and tracks dumb messages. This command will fetch a few random messages from that user and generate a report.  

üìå **Note:** The username is the global username, not the server nickname or display name.  

‚ùì **Help Command:**  
`!s help`  
Displays this help page.  

Enjoy exposing the dumbest messages! üòú
